# H+ Isolation 
H+ is an award winning 3-day collaboration project between Graz University of Technology and the University of Wesminster. Player Character is half human/half machine and is locked up in a skyscraper-like concentration camp (human/machine bastards are not well liked in this society, which consists of either humans or machines – no hybrids) in a dystopian future. The player is weak and sick because his immune-system isn’t as good as the one of a “real” human and he is left to die. Of course he wants to flee! Gameplay: The goal of the game is to escape the building. The building consists of lots of floors, each floor represents one level. The gameplay of a level is divided into two parts: first a 3D stealth part and then a 2D puzzle part. In the 3D part the player has to sneak past the guards and reach the floor exit. The floor exit however is locked and an puzzle has to be solved to advance to the next floor/level. The result of the puzzle also influences the players abilitys during the next level.
